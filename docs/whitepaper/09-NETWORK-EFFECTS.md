## 7. Network Effects and Adoption

### 7.1 Bootstrap Problem

Value accrues only when multiple stakeholders adopt shared infrastructure. First movers bear costs with minimal benefit. Tipping point requires critical mass.

**Adoption Pathway:**

1. **Independent artists**: No legacy infrastructure to abandon. Lowest switching costs. Highest benefit from transparent, low-cost distribution.

2. **Electronic music labels**: Already operate parallel economy. Cultural alignment with decentralization. Existing fan base comfortable with token economics.

3. **Mid-tier labels**: Feel pressure from independents succeeding without traditional infrastructure. Seek competitive advantage through lower costs.

4. **Streaming platforms**: Adopt gateway access when sufficient catalog exists. Reduce infrastructure costs while maintaining service quality.

5. **Major labels**: Adopt when competitive pressure forces modernization. Retain artist relationships while outsourcing infrastructure.

### 7.2 Incentive Alignment

**Artists:**
- Lower costs ($0.40 vs $4,600 over 70 years)
- Retain ownership
- Faster payments
- Transparent accounting

**Distributors:**
- Eliminate infrastructure overhead
- Compete on service quality
- Earn validation fees
- Expand addressable market to independents

**Platforms:**
- Reduce storage costs by 99%+
- Instant licensing verification
- Automated payment distribution
- Focus on core competency (user experience)

**Fans:**
- Economic participation in artist success
- Transparent view of support impact
- Direct funding mechanism
- Potential financial returns

These incentives are real, not speculative. The $4,600 vs $0.40 comparison is math, not marketing.
