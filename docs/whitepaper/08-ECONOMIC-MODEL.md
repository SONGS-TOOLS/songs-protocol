## 6. Economic Model

### 6.1 Token Structure

**SongShares (Recording Rights Token):**

Each recording divides into 10,000 shares representing 0.01% each. Shares can be:
- Sold for upfront capital
- Distributed to collaborators as payment
- Awarded to fans for engagement
- Traded on secondary markets

This creates liquidity for an asset class (master recordings) historically illiquid for anyone except major labels.

**Composition Tokens (Publishing Rights):**

Parallel structure for composition rights. Enables:
- Sync licensing (film, TV, games)
- Mechanical licensing (covers, reproductions)
- Performance royalty distribution through PRO integration

Separating recording and composition rights on-chain matches how the industry already operates legally. The innovation is making both transparent and liquid.

**Governance Token:**

Protocol governance token earned through:
- Creation (uploading releases)
- Validation (quality control work)
- Curation (playlist creation, promotion)
- Fan engagement (listening, sharing, purchasing)

Used for:
- Protocol governance votes
- Validator staking
- Priority features
- Tipping artists

### 6.2 Revenue Flows

**Artist Perspective:**
- Upload costs: $0.40 per track (one-time)
- Blockchain registration: $0.01-0.05 (one-time)
- Distribution through protocol: 0-10% (versus 15-30% traditional)
- Retain ownership permanently
- Automated royalty splits eliminate accounting overhead

**Distributor Perspective:**
- Eliminate storage infrastructure costs
- Reduce to curation and customer service
- Earn fees for validation work
- Maintain DSP relationships
- Compete on service quality, not infrastructure lock-in

**Streaming Platform Perspective:**
- Reduce to caching and transcoding
- Eliminate long-term storage costs
- Instant licensing verification
- Automated royalty payment
- Focus on user experience

**Fan Perspective:**
- Gain economic stake in artists they support
- Direct funding through share purchases
- Transparent view of artist revenue
- Potential secondary market returns
