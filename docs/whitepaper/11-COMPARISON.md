## 9. Comparison to Alternative Approaches

### 9.1 Traditional Cloud Storage

**Pros:**
- Mature technology
- High availability
- Familiar to industry

**Cons:**
- Recurring costs over 70 years
- Company-dependent (provider bankruptcy = data loss)
- Redundant across stakeholders
- No cryptographic verification of ownership

### 9.2 IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)

**Pros:**
- Content-addressed storage
- Decentralized architecture
- No single point of failure

**Cons:**
- No economic incentive to store unpopular content
- Requires pinning services (back to recurring costs)
- No guarantee of permanence
- Slower retrieval than CDNs

### 9.3 Filecoin

**Pros:**
- Decentralized storage marketplace
- Economic incentives for storage providers
- Content verification

**Cons:**
- Still requires ongoing payment to maintain storage
- Deal renewal needed periodically
- More complex than pure permanent storage
- Higher costs than Arweave for long-term storage

### 9.4 Private Blockchain Consortiums

**Pros:**
- Faster transactions
- Privacy controlled by consortium
- Industry-specific governance

**Cons:**
- Requires trust in consortium members
- Vulnerable to consortium dissolution
- Limited composability with external systems
- Replicates existing gatekeeping dynamics

The proposed architecture (Arweave + public blockchain) provides the optimal combination: permanent storage, cryptographic verification, and composability with broader web3 ecosystem.
