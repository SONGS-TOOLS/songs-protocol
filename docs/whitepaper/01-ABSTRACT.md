# Permanent Digital Music Infrastructure: A Technical and Economic Analysis

**Working Draft v1.1 - Updated with Live Protocol Data**

---


## Abstract

This paper examines structural inefficiencies in contemporary music industry infrastructure across six interconnected dimensions: rights fragmentation, payment opacity, temporal misalignment, value extraction by intermediaries, lack of verifiability, and storage redundancy. Current systems fail to provide a unified source of truth for ownership, delay payments through complex reconciliation processes, operate on technological lifecycles incompatible with 70-100 year copyright terms, capture value through unnecessary intermediation, lack cryptographic verification mechanisms, and duplicate identical data across stakeholders. We propose a decentralized technical architecture that addresses these problems systematically through immutable storage networks, blockchain-based rights registries, automated payment distribution, and cryptographic verification. Economic analysis demonstrates order-of-magnitude cost reductions while improving transparency, permanence, and accessibility.

**Keywords:** music infrastructure, rights management, blockchain, payment distribution, decentralized systems, copyright, royalty automation
