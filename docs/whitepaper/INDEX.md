### Key Sections
- [Current Status (Live Protocol)](02-EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md#current-status-live-since-february-2025) - 3,000+ songs, 1,100+ artists, $5,000+ distributed
- [Seven Structural Problems](04-CURRENT-STATE-ANALYSIS.md) - Rights fragmentation, payment opacity, temporal misalignment, etc.
- [Technical Architecture](06-PROPOSED-ARCHITECTURE.md) - Rights registry, permanent storage, smart contracts, gateways
- [Song Lifecycle](03-INTRODUCTION.md#15-song-lifecycle-through-the-system) - Complete workflow from upload to payment
- [Economic Impact](02-EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md#key-benefits) - 99.99% storage cost reduction, 80-120% artist revenue increase

### Protocol Status
**SONGS Protocol v1 is operational since February 2025:**
- 3,000+ songs uploaded to permanent storage
- 1,100+ artists verified using the protocol
- 10,000 SongShares per song created (fractional ownership tokens)
- $5,000+ in distribution earnings distributed to SongShare owners
- SongShares (v1) - Recording rights tokens active and trading

### Key Metrics
- **Storage costs**: 99.99% reduction over 70 years ($0.40 vs $4,600 per track)
- **Payment fees**: 99.98% reduction through disintermediation
- **Settlement times**: From 9-18 months to minutes for international payments
- **Artist revenue**: 80-120% increase without changing consumer pricing
- **Global collection**: Single on-chain registration replaces ~250 territorial contracts

## Document Structure

This whitepaper is organized into four main parts:

1. **Problem Analysis** (Sections 1-2): Identifies and analyzes seven structural problems in the music industry
2. **Technical Solution** (Sections 3-5): Proposes a decentralized architecture to solve these problems
3. **Economics and Adoption** (Sections 6-7): Analyzes economic models and adoption dynamics
4. **Implementation and Future** (Sections 8-12): Addresses challenges, comparisons, and future implications

Each section can be read independently, but they build upon each other to present a complete picture of the SONGS Protocol architecture and its potential impact on the music industry.
