## 12. Risk Analysis

### 12.1 Technical Risks

**Storage network failure:**
- **Probability:** Low (Arweave operational since 2018, multiple incentive mechanisms)
- **Impact:** High (data loss)
- **Mitigation:** Parallel storage on IPFS or Filecoin as backup layer

**Smart contract vulnerabilities:**
- **Probability:** Medium (all smart contracts carry risk)
- **Impact:** High (fund loss, ownership disputes)
- **Mitigation:** Formal verification, audits, gradual rollout, bug bounties

**Blockchain network disruption:**
- **Probability:** Low (established L2s have strong track records)
- **Impact:** Medium (temporary service disruption)
- **Mitigation:** Multi-chain deployment, fallback mechanisms

### 12.2 Adoption Risks

**Network effects fail to materialize:**
- **Probability:** Medium (many two-sided marketplaces fail to bootstrap)
- **Impact:** High (protocol has minimal value without adoption)
- **Mitigation:** Focus on independent artists first, demonstrate cost savings, build validator network early

**Legal barriers:**
- **Probability:** Medium (regulatory uncertainty in some jurisdictions)
- **Impact:** Medium to High (could block adoption in major markets)
- **Mitigation:** Work with legal experts per jurisdiction, position as infrastructure layer, integrate with existing legal frameworks

**Major label resistance:**
- **Probability:** High (majors resist disruption to existing business models)
- **Impact:** Medium (independents can succeed without majors, but major adoption accelerates timeline)
- **Mitigation:** Demonstrate value through indie success, focus on cost savings, offer gradual migration paths

### 12.3 Economic Risks

**Token price volatility:**
- **Probability:** High (crypto markets are volatile)
- **Impact:** Medium (affects governance token value, not core functionality)
- **Mitigation:** Separate core functionality from token price, use stablecoins for payments where appropriate

**Storage cost assumptions wrong:**
- **Probability:** Low to Medium (historical trends strong but not guaranteed)
- **Impact:** Medium (reduces but doesn't eliminate cost advantage)
- **Mitigation:** Even at 10x higher costs, permanent storage remains cheaper than 70 years of cloud infrastructure

**Revenue insufficient to sustain ecosystem:**
- **Probability:** Low (protocol fees minimal, most value accrues to artists and validators)
- **Impact:** Low (protocol is infrastructure, not a business requiring profitability)
- **Mitigation:** Keep protocol lean, focus on public good aspects, minimal ongoing costs
