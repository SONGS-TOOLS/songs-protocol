## 🚀 Protocol Status

**SONGS Protocol v1 is operational since February 2025:**

- ✅ **3,000+ songs uploaded** to permanent storage
- ✅ **1,100+ artists verified** using the protocol
- ✅ **10,000 SongShares per song** created (fractional ownership tokens)
- ✅ **$5,000+ in distribution earnings** distributed to SongShare owners
- ✅ **SongShares (v1)** - Recording rights tokens active and trading

## 📊 Key Metrics

- **Storage costs**: 99.99% reduction over 70 years ($0.40 vs $4,600 per track)
- **Payment fees**: 99.98% reduction through disintermediation
- **Settlement times**: From 9-18 months to minutes for international payments
- **Artist revenue**: 80-120% increase without changing consumer pricing
- **Global collection**: Single on-chain registration replaces ~250 territorial contracts

## 🔍 Key Topics

### The Seven Structural Problems
1. **Rights Fragmentation** - ~250 territorial PROs with no unified source of truth
2. **Payment Opacity** - 9-18 month international payment cycles, 30-50% administrative fees
3. **Temporal Misalignment** - 70-100 year copyrights vs. 10-year tech lifecycles
4. **Intermediary Value Extraction** - 30-70% revenue capture through gatekeeping
5. **Lack of Verifiability** - Trust-based systems vulnerable to fraud and disputes
6. **Storage Redundancy** - Identical files duplicated across all stakeholders
7. **Payment-Consumption Disconnection** - Streaming creates monopolistic platforms

### The Solution
- **Permanent Storage (Arweave)**: $0.40 one-time vs $4,600 traditional (99.99% cost reduction)
- **Blockchain Registry**: Single source of truth with cryptographic verification
- **Smart Contracts**: Atomic payment distribution in minutes, not months
- **Gateway Network**: Controlled access without centralized gatekeeping
- **Validation Layer**: Quality control through reputation-based incentives
