- Enable optimizer with appropriate runs setting
- Use viaIR for complex contracts
- Configure multiple compiler versions for compatibility

## Deployment Scripts
- Use TypeScript for all deployment scripts
- Implement proper error handling
- Include contract verification
- Use deterministic addresses when needed
- Document deployment addresses

## Testing Configuration
- Use Hardhat's built-in testing framework
- Configure gas reporting
- Use contract sizer for optimization
- Enable parallel test execution

## Security
- Never commit private keys to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement proper access controls in deployment scripts
