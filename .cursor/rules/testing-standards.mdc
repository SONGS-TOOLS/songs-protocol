# Testing Standards

## Test Organization
- Group tests by contract functionality
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Organize tests in logical test suites
- Use fixtures for common test setup

## Test Coverage
- Test all public and external functions
- Include both success and failure cases
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Test access control and permissions
- Test event emissions

## Gas Testing
- Include gas usage tests for critical functions
- Monitor gas consumption changes
- Optimize for gas efficiency
- Test with different input sizes

## Security Testing
- Test for common vulnerabilities
- Test access control mechanisms
- Test reentrancy protection
- Test overflow/underflow scenarios
- Test with malicious inputs

## Integration Testing
- Test contract interactions
- Test deployment scenarios
- Test upgrade scenarios
- Test with real network conditions

## Test Data
- Use realistic test data
- Test with different user scenarios
- Use proper test accounts
- Clean up test state between tests
